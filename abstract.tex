The main goal of this thesis is to facilitate the process of
industrial automated systems development applying formal methods to ensure the
reliability of systems. A new formulation of the distributed diagnosability
problem in terms of Discrete Event Systems theory and automata framework is
presented. In the new approach a property of modular diagnosability as a
special case of distributed diagnosability is considered as a target. Existing
modules of a system are composed into new \emph{virtual modules} such that these
modules satisfy the property of modular diagnosability, i.e. the approach
enforces the desired property of the system, rather then just verifying it.
The approach tackles the state explosion problem with modeling patterns and new
algorithms with a low computational burden. The concepts introduced in this work
are validated with a newly developed software tool.
