=======================================================
List of components:

Object Name	Amount
-------------------------
. Butterfly valve	2
. Gate valve	3
. Screw conveyer	1
. Vibrator		1
. Belt conveyer	1
. Fork level sensor	4
. Air pump	1
-------------------------
All of them	13

If add other two filters, it would be 23 objects (automata)
For DI/DO you can make another (LOTS of) automata

Control models:
. Unload of the pneumatic container
. Load of the pneumatic container (belt conveyer)
. Unload the filter
. Regulate air temperature
. Regulate air pressure

not modeled:
. Temp measure	2
. Pressure meas.	2
. Weight measure	1
. Flow measure	1
